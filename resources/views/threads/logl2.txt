In command line:

php artisan make:test ThreadTest


In ThreadTest.php

/** @test */ //THIS IS IMPORTANT IT IS TO TRIGGER THE TESTING
public function a_user_can_browser_threads()
{
    $response = $this->get('/threads');
    $response->assertStatus(200);
}


In command line:

phpunit

//to run the testing comment


Result:

There was 1 failure:

1) Tests\Feature\ThreadTest::a_user_can_browser_threads
Expected status code 200 but received 404.
Failed asserting that false is true.

/home/vagrant/code/laraapp/vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Testing/TestResponse.php:151
/home/vagrant/code/laraapp/tests/Feature/ThreadTest.php:23

Back to the test:

   $response = $this->get('/threads’);// using get method to connect to /threads
    $response->assertStatus(200);// expect to have the status 200(OK Standard) but see 404 NOT FOUND




In this point we have to make sure we setup  the route ‘/threads’  and controller very clear


Also you can test weather the view has thing like title  or not

public function a_user_can_browser_threads()
{
    $thread=factory('App\Thread')->create();
    $response = $this->get('/threads');
    $response->assertStatus(200);
    $response->assertSee($thread->title);
}
